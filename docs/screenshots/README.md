# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots for the GitHub README.

## Required Screenshots

Please create the following screenshots and save them here:

1. **dashboard.png** - The main dashboard view showing:
   - Monthly Total, Yearly Total, Year to Date, and Active Subscriptions cards
   - Should show the cost summary at a glance

2. **subscription-list.png** - The subscription list showing:
   - Several subscriptions with custom images/logos
   - Different categories visible
   - The Add, Sort, and Export buttons in the toolbar

3. **add-subscription.png** - The add/edit subscription form showing:
   - All input fields (name, cost, billing cycle, category, etc.)

4. **dark-theme.png** - The app in dark theme showing:
   - Any view (dashboard or list) to demonstrate the dark theme

## Screenshot Guidelines

- Use a window size around 1000x700 (or the default app size)
- Include some sample data to show the app in action
- Use clear, readable fonts and sufficient zoom if needed
- PNG format preferred for quality
- Try to capture the full window with titlebar/chrome removed (or crop cleanly)
